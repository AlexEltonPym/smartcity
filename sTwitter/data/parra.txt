"What's wrong with people? This is Parramatta Road, not a quiet Annandale back street!!" They should address the parking issues, and I think work will need to be done to deal with noise emanating from the building, but sheesh... if you can't build there, where can you build?

State walks away from joint study on track-free trams for Parramatta Road 
Some route 909 and M92 buses are delayed up to 45 minutes through Auburn due to heavy traffic on Parramatta Road.
You know youre having a v good day when theres barely any traffic on Parramatta Road 
That's to travel about 16km, almost all of which was just bumper-to-bumper Parramatta road. The M4 isn't finished, so the toll is there in no small TO discourage ppl from using it.

It's a deterrent, but it's not going to go away once the M4 IS finished.
So instead, they've built a bigass motorway right along next to a good bit of Parramatta Road. You can see it on google maps if you want. That motorway was free, having been paid off by tolls, but now it's being widened & that costs money, so...
Nowhere is this more apparent than Parramatta Road, a narrow-ass piece of crap road that can't be widened at all to allow for more traffic, cars being the only way to get to too many places, because?

NEOLIBERAL GOVERNMENTS HATE PUBLIC TRANSPORT.
Would have been a higher hourly rate but Parramatta Road is problematic during necessary night work. 
On Monday I paid $60 an hour for a half hour uber trip in which a driver turned up promptly, treated me courteously, got route right and obeyed Australian road rules. That's the new norm.

and too unattractive for those who don't.

New plan for Parramatta Road featuring narrow guided electric transit vehicles i.e. Narrow light rail without the rails! Announced today.
This is gradually driving me up the wall. It talks about "tramless trams" fixing Parramatta Road. PARRAMATTA ROAD IS ALREADY FULL OF BUSES. 
The word "bus" doesn't make an appearance in this article; the below photo is captioned as being a "trackless tram": http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-28/parramatta-road-proposal-for-trackless-electric-trams/8393738  
Sooo the trackless tram is a dedicated bus lane up the middle of parramatta road with no way for passengers to get to the kerb?
Seriously? We'll fix Parramatta Road traffic if we put bendy buses in the middle of the road and call them trams? https://goo.gl/Jgf0kn 
Sydney's Parramatta Road track-free, electric trams to ease congestion http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-28/parramatta-road-proposal-for-trackless-electric-trams/8393738  via @abcnews Its not a tram it's a Bus!
"Track free trams" down Parramatta Road.

A "track free tram" is faster than a bus because it runs down the middle of Parramatta Road, safe from passengers. #nswpol
just heard @2GBNews that @AndrewConstance is looking at feasibility of laying tram tracks on parramatta road .

@innerwestcouncil considers track-free trams for Parramatta Road http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/trackfree-electric-trams-proposed-for-parramatta-road-20170327-gv7c0g.html  via @smh
Track-free trams could be shuttling passengers along Parramatta Road within the next five years 
"Track-free electric trams proposed for Parramatta Road" such a simple idea and not far off the tested European ones http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/trackfree-electric-trams-proposed-for-parramatta-road-20170327-gv7c0g.html 
My 5 is that any infrastructure that goes into Parramatta Road *must* come at the expense of car/truck movements, all else is fantasy
'saving of including the significant hills which are part of Parramatta Road'
A tram without tracks, or wires (a bus) might be part of the solution to parramatta road. But first. We must bulldoze the inner west.
